title: 'Never a waste: How missteps can lead us to meaningful change'

From buying stamps to banking, sending mail to exchanging money, the Post Office’s dozens of services require thousands of forms. So, what if we made them all available for citizens to download online? Is that meaningful change? Or just a bit of a misstep?

It’s hard to be visionary when the day-to-day is so demanding.

Working in government, where pre-existing projects cross your path and legacy technology is a tripping hazard, it’s easier to focus on what’s possible than what’s right. Getting something, anything, done can become the be-all-end-all – and the driver of all your decisions. But if you want to become the face of public sector technology, you know you need to pursue meaningful change.

So, where should you look?


## Start your search where user journeys end

The trends concerning other organisations don’t always apply to us. As Steve writes, it’s more important the public sector keeps up than gets ahead. But with nobody to follow, we usually have to find our own way. And sometimes, naturally, it’s not perfect first time. Here’s an example.

One government agency found that citizens were abandoning a complicated online journey and opting instead to call the number shown on each page. The result? Failure waste in the purpose-built service. And failure demand putting pressure on another.

Failure waste is when users hit an obstacle and abandon your service – reducing your return on investment. Failure demand is when users hit an obstacle and turn from your purpose-built service to a more expensive or less suitable alternative. This government agency had built a service that wasn’t serving its purpose – and was stuck paying for the backup option, too.

But failure needn’t be a waste.
